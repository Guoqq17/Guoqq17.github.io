    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h1><p>I decided to start a robotics project since I have been becoming more and more interested in robotics (especially, connected and autonomous vehicles). In this project, I will build a 4WD car prototype using a commercial car kit. After setting the environment of both hardware and software, I will focus on three interesting topics: learn the robot operating system (ROS), simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and vechile control. I currently do not know how far I can go, but we will see.</p><h1 id="Prototype-building-Hardware">2. Prototype building: Hardware</h1><p>Since the focuses (i.e., ROS, SLAM, and control) of this project are mainly software/algorithm oriented, I choose to use a car kit instead of building a self-designed car from scratch. The hardware that I use is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJB7SWZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Yahboom Super Starter AI Robot Kit</a>, a 4WD electrical car kit coming along with multiple sensors including camera, ultrasonic, and line tracking module. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TC2BK1X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Raspberry Pi 4B (64Bit, 4GB)</a> is selected as the onboard computer due to its powerful computation capability. It takes me and Xiaoping (thanks to my wife) 3 hours to assemble the car. It looks like this:</p><div align="center">  <img src="/2021/01/02/4WD-Car-SLAM-and-Control-1/Yahboom_car_kit_my.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"></div><h1 id="Prototype-building-Development-environment">3.
